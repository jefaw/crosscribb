Next JS:
- A framework built on top of react 
- Enables server-side rendering and static site generation

Server Side rendering:
- With CRA everything is loaded and rendered on the client
- This makes things fast and dynamic (don't have to request new page from server)
- When you open source code in browser you won't see any HTML content except the root div containing all the JS files
- Terrible for SEO since search engine crawlers can't pick up content (H1s ect)
- Next allows first page load to be rendered by the server
- This is great for SEO & performance
- Get the best of both worlds

Other Advantages:
- Easy routing using pages folder (No need to use React Router)
- Ability to create API routes in Next file structure
- Export static website (can be run without server)
- Static websites can be hosted anywhere
- Easy deployment (Can host on any service that can host a Node app)
- Can use Vercel for deployment
